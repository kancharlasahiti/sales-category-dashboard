Dashboard showing category trends using Pivot Tables in Google Sheets.
# 📊 Sales Category Dashboard – Google Sheets Pivot Table Project

This dashboard explores how product categories vary across global regions using Pivot Tables and stacked column charts. Built entirely in Google Sheets, it reflects my journey as a student learning to visualize data with clarity and creativity.

## 🌱 What It Shows
- Distribution of product categories (Clothing, Electronics, Home, Sports)
- Regional breakdown across Asia, Europe, North America, and South America
- Total counts and visual trends using stacked column charts

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Google Sheets
- Pivot Table (Count of Most_Frequent_Category by Region)
- Stacked Column Chart for visual storytelling

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to summarize data using Pivot Tables
- How to visualize categorical trends across regions
- How to adapt when Excel isn’t activated — using Google Sheets as a creative workaround
> “Even when Excel didn’t cooperate, I found clarity in Google Sheets — and built a dashboard that speaks.”

## 📁 Files Included
- `Sales_Category_Analysis.xlsx` (downloaded from Google Sheets)
- `README.md` (this file)
